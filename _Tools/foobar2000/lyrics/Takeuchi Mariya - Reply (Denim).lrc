[00:19.25]I have seen
[00:21.60]Too many sad eyes look at me
[00:27.20]And eyes that set me free
[00:31.90]All the places that I've been
[00:40.21][01:55.34][03:00.63]Thank you for
[00:44.97][02:00.48][03:05.77]The letters that you thought you wrote in vain
[00:52.33][02:07.70][03:13.10]And for
[00:55.04][02:10.32][03:15.77]The times you chose to stand out in the rain
[01:01.85][02:17.74][03:23.13]And wait
[01:04.70][01:09.59]For me
[01:14.81]Your words
[01:17.62]Your words have made us see
[01:22.53]A little honesty
[01:27.48]In a world that doesn't share
[01:34.57]And your eyes
[01:37.52]Tell the story of your pain
[01:42.05]Severity of your destiny
[01:47.57]In a world that doesn't care
[02:40.97]You
[02:43.19]You understand my pain
[02:48.07]From this I gather strength
[02:53.13]In that we are the same
[03:25.96]The life I live would never be the same
[03:33.04][03:49.69]Without you here
[03:40.59][03:45.52]You here
[04:07.12](End)
