[00:23.41]you took a mystery and made me want it
[00:27.18]You got a pedestal and put me on it
[00:31.00]You made me love you out of feeling nothing
[00:34.63]Something that you do
[00:38.88]And i was there and not dancing with anyone
[00:42.22]You took a little, then you took me over
[00:45.83]You set your mark on stealing my heart away
[00:49.38]Crying, trying, anything for you
[00:53.48]I'm in the middle of a chain reaction
[00:57.20]You give me all the after midnight action
[01:01.17]I wanna get you where i can let you make all that love to me
[01:08.71]I'm on a journey for the inspiration
[01:12.40]To anywhere and there ain't no salvation
[01:16.11]I need you to get me nearer to you
[01:19.23]So you can set me free
[01:22.22][01:29.69][02:42.94]We talk about love, love, love
[01:25.78][01:33.33][02:46.63]We talk about love
[01:44.29]You make me tremble when your hand moves lower
[01:47.82]You taste a little then you swollow slower
[01:51.65]Nature has a way of yielding treasure
[01:55.46]Pleasure made for you, oh
[01:59.22]You gotta plan, your future is on the run
[02:02.95]Shine a light for the whole world over
[02:06.73]You never find your love if you hide away
[02:14.38]Get in the middle of a chain reaction
[02:17.92][02:58.10]You get a medal when you're lost in action
[02:21.80]I wanna get your love all ready for the sweet sensation
[02:27.51]Instant radiation
[02:29.65][02:50.58]You let me hold you for the first explosion
[02:32.88]We get a picture of our love in motion
[02:36.93]My arms will cover, my lips will smother you
[02:40.13]With no more left to say
[02:54.48]Arms will cover you
[02:56.12]All you gotta do is get in the middle of a chain reaction
[03:05.58]Don't pass me by
[03:07.51]I wanna get your love all ready for the chain reaction ...
