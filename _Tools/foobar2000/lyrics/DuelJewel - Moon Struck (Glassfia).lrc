[00:28.16][03:56.89]I remember when I found you that day
[00:31.11][04:00.17]bound together in misterious ways
[00:34.21][01:47.70][04:03.18]know what happened,magic?so to speak,
[00:38.44][01:51.89][04:07.42]something came to life
[00:40.36]you were singing softly in the rain
[00:43.44]I was lost under the cloud of gray
[00:46.44][01:59.96]something happened,magic?so to speak,
[00:50.85][02:04.16]colors came alive
[00:52.79][02:06.14]even the seven wonders of the world
[00:58.67]seems such an easy solve with you now
[01:04.51][01:22.87][03:07.77][03:20.03][03:38.30]Take me far away so far away
[01:06.70][03:09.99]from my heavy hearted days.
[01:09.02][03:12.29]and let it rain
[01:10.63][02:24.92][03:13.85][03:26.10]together we escape to the moonlit night
[01:13.01][02:27.29][03:16.21][03:28.40]let's forget the morning light
[01:15.18][02:29.56][03:18.43]and getaway now
[01:17.13]In your armw I'll be so strong
[01:20.15]hold me so tight I'llnever fall
[01:25.15]In your armw so I can,
[01:27.08]so I can smile tomorrow
[01:41.29]you didn't get the picture right away
[01:44.55]but you knew that it was me always
[01:53.85]you discovered me quite the same
[01:56.91]we were mirrors in a world of gray
[02:12.22]will be an easy solve with you now
[02:18.97]Take you far away so far away
[02:20.97][03:22.25]from the dark and sleepless nights
[02:23.42][03:24.47]away from the rain
[02:31.42]I'll hold you so you can be strong
[02:34.40]I'll set you free so you'll never fall
[02:37.04]Take you far away So far away
[02:39.37]In my arms so you can,
[02:41.60]so you can smile tomorrow
[03:30.41]away getaway now
[03:32.66]together we can be so strong
[03:35.73]together nothing can go wrong
[03:40.59]In your arms so we can,
[03:42.78]so we can make it tomorrow
