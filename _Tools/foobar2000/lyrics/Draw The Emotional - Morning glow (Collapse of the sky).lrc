[00:09.92]Morning glow morning glow
[00:15.00]Starts to glimmer when you know
[00:19.88]Winds of change are set to blow
[00:24.04]And sweep this whole land through
[00:28.96][01:02.40]Morning glow is long past due
[00:37.40][01:29.74][02:00.89][02:25.28][03:11.77] 
[00:43.30]Morning glow fill the earth
[00:48.48]Come on shine far all you're worth
[00:53.32]We'll be present at the birth
[00:57.51]Of all faith looking new
[01:10.27][02:06.14]Oh oh morning glow
[01:17.16][02:11.90]I'd like to help you grow
[01:22.08]You should have started long ago
[01:33.53]Morning glow all days long
[01:38.79]For we sing tomorrow's song
[01:43.09]Never knew we could be so strong
[01:47.43]But now it's very clear
[01:52.36]Morning glow is almost here
[02:16.71]We should have started long ago
[02:26.41]Morning glow all your life
[02:33.12]We can make the new day right
[02:39.97]All the bad songs of the night
[02:45.66]Will fade into the past
[02:54.30]Morning glow is here at last
