[00:43.85]I like no interruption when the game is on
[00:45.98]I like slam-dunks that take me to the hoop
[00:48.16]My favorite play is the alley-oop
[00:50.57]I like the pick-n-roll
[00:51.70]I like the give-n-go

[01:16.84]I might cross you up and fake one way
[01:18.77]Turn around and hit you wit the MJ fade-away
[01:21.68]I throwin down passes like J-Kidd

[01:44.00]When I’m in the paint the defense so shook
[01:45.84]They don’t know if I’m gonna put up a slow hook or dish up a no-look
