[00:01.10][00:18.72][00:25.86][00:49.27][01:10.63][01:17.83][01:39.09][01:54.61][02:02.52][02:18.44][02:37.38] 
[00:02.45]She's got my heart strapped down
[00:04.40]To the beat just like an 808.
[00:06.55]Did you know I'm thinking of you every day?
[00:08.53][00:09.30][00:10.23][01:00.31][01:01.08][01:02.31]Is it wrong?
[00:11.27]Is it too loud now?
[00:12.43]Is it shaking up your bones,
[00:13.90]Yeah, from head down to your toes?
[00:16.23][00:17.21][00:18.32][01:07.73][01:09.11][01:10.13]Roll along.
[00:19.05][01:11.06][01:55.10]She's gonna move like the smoke in your lungs.,
[00:20.73][01:12.55][01:56.39]And I've been dreaming I can feel her on the tip of my tongue,
[00:22.51][01:14.47][01:58.36]And tell me how you're feeling,
[00:23.88][01:15.73][01:59.49]We could touch the ceiling.
[00:24.82][01:16.58]Jump-start my heart.
[00:26.53][01:18.28][02:02.93]Oh, girl,
[00:27.27][01:19.70][02:03.74]I wanna know your love.
[00:29.71][01:21.59][02:05.60]I wanna feel your warmth on my skin (so recklessly).
[00:34.75][01:26.42][02:10.27]I'll show up and be your summer love,
[00:37.68][01:29.61][02:13.58]'Cause you're the breakout feeling of my week (so endlessly).
[00:42.50][01:34.54]Say there's still time. Ooo
[00:49.92]Did you feel the bass stop?
[00:51.47]Drop your heart,
[00:52.40][01:40.51]Pick it up, yeah.
[00:54.01]I wanna see your night eyes,
[00:55.37]And if it feels right,
[00:56.31]Then maybe we can be alone.
[00:58.24]Take everything around you,
[00:59.35]Let me surround you,
[01:02.63]Is it too late now,
[01:04.04]For me to compliment your style?
[01:05.94]You've got that subtle grace for miles.
[01:39.61]Feel your heart drop,
[01:42.06]And I can tell we're gonna be alone.
[01:45.76]So when the heat lacks,
[01:47.90]Bring it back,
[01:48.52]Could you be my own?
[01:50.34]'Cause the weather's getting kinda cold.
[02:01.25]Oh, oh.
[02:19.30]Night sky,
[02:19.85]Light up your diamond eyes,
[02:21.72]And baby, you won't feel alone
[02:24.97]I'll show up, and be your summer love,
[02:29.74]And feel the heat seep through my bones.
[02:34.07](So endlessly)
