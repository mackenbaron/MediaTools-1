[00:32.02]Innocent, and in a sense I am
[00:38.15]Guilty of the crime that's now in hand
[00:45.33][00:51.87]Such a nice day
[00:47.74]Throw your life away
[00:54.70]Let it go
[00:58.70][02:54.41]Cold these eyes, I can't believe it
[01:06.06]Cold, this heart is slow
[01:11.52]Heart is slow
[01:29.87]Call me
[01:32.42]Such a cold heart
[01:35.53]Such a cold man
[01:38.59]Watch you tear your self apart
[01:43.35][01:49.87]So lay me down
[01:46.11]My soul to give
[01:52.72]The longest sleep
[01:56.50]Oh, the longest sleep
[02:13.74]In I come and out you go you get
[02:19.88]Here we are again now, place your bets
[02:26.42][02:33.46]Is this the time
[02:29.26]The time to win or lose
[02:36.04]The time to choose
[03:01.52]So deep inside a cold fire
[03:08.33]Cold, this heart is slow...
[03:32.14]Anytime you're only a kiss away
[03:47.40]Won't you do it now
[03:49.05]That's right, just keep me going
[03:52.38]In some white track
[03:54.35]You come the right track
[03:55.36]Cartoon cutout
[03:57.00]Cut throat bled out
[03:58.56]I'm on your side
[04:00.25]Be on the both side
[04:01.81]I'm alright Jack
[04:03.56]You get off my back
[04:05.21]I'm no dope
[04:06.74]I give you hope
[04:08.48][04:09.88]Here's the rope
[04:11.52]Now...swing away
[04:14.59]End
