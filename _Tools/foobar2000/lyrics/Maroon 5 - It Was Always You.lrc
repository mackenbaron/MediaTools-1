[00:02.45]for joan...
[00:11.09]Beauty queen of only eighteen
[00:15.11]She had some trouble with herself
[00:20.25]He was always there to help her
[00:24.57]She always belonged to someone else
[00:29.39][00:46.89][01:15.16][01:36.45][01:55.61] 
[00:30.22]I drove for miles and miles
[00:33.64]And wound up at your door
[00:39.20]I’ve had you so many times but somehow
[00:44.28]I want more
[00:48.13][01:56.63][03:07.65]I don’t mind spending everyday
[00:53.09][02:01.13][03:11.87]Out on your corner in the pouring rain
[00:57.59][02:06.16][03:16.61]Look for the girl with the broken smile
[01:02.73][02:11.08][03:22.18]Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
[01:05.95][02:14.44][03:25.03]And she will be loved
[01:10.50][02:21.42][03:29.45][03:37.53]She will be loved
[01:19.03][02:57.84]Tap on my window knock on my door
[01:23.59][03:03.16]I want to make you feel beautiful
[01:28.65]I know I tend to get insecure
[01:33.22]It doesn’t matter anymore
[01:38.47]It’s not always rainbows and butterflies
[01:41.79]It’s compromise that moves us along
[01:47.13]My heart is full and my door’s always open
[01:53.00]You can come anytime you want
[02:23.76]....
[02:34.85]I know where you hide
[02:37.41]Alone in your car
[02:39.52]Know all of the things that make you who you are
[02:44.16]I know that goodbye means nothing at all
[02:48.16]Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls
