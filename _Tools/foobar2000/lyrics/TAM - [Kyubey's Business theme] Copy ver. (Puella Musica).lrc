[00:08.48]I forbid you maidens all that wear gold in your hair
[00:15.43]To travel to Carter Hall for young Tam Lin is there
[00:23.42]None that go by Carter Hall but they leave him a pledge
[00:31.02]Either their mantles of green or else their maidenhead
[00:38.14][03:17.97]Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
[00:46.66][03:24.84]And she's gone to Carter Hall as fast as go can she
[00:54.86]She'd not pulled a double rose, a rose but only two
[01:01.81]When up there came young Tam Lin says Lady, pull no more
[01:09.81]And why come you to Carter Hall without command from me?
[01:17.39]I'll come and go, young Janet said, and ask no leave of thee
[01:54.64]tied Janet her kirtle green a bit above her knee
[02:01.13]And she's gone to her father as fast as go can she
[02:09.33]Well, up then spoke her father dear and he spoke meek and mild
[02:16.21]Oh, and alas, Janet, he said, I think you go with child
[02:24.40]Well, if that be so, Janet said, myself shall bear the blame
[02:31.63]There's not a knight in all your hall shall get the baby's name
[02:40.28]For if my love were an earthly knight as he is an elfin grey
[02:47.27]I'd not change my own true love for any knight you have
[03:33.26]Oh, tell to me, Tam Lin, she said, why came you here to dwell?
[03:40.71]The Queen of Faeries caught me when from my horse I fell
[03:49.48]And at the end of seven years she pays a tithe to hell
[03:56.77]I so fair and full of flesh and feared it be myself
[04:05.76]But tonight is Hallowe'en and the faery folk ride
[04:11.50]Those that would their true love win at Miles Cross they must buy
[04:19.54]So first let past the horses black and then let past the brown
[04:26.66]Quickly run to the white steed and pull the rider down
[04:35.29]For I'll ride on the white steed, the nearest to the town
[04:42.08]For I was an earthly knight, they give me that renown
[04:50.77]Oh, they will turn me in your arms to a newt or a snake
[04:57.54]But hold me tight and fear not, I am your baby's father
[05:06.00]And they will turn me in your arms into a lion bold
[05:13.32]But hold me tight and fear not and you will love your child
[05:22.36]And they will turn me in your arms into a naked knight
[05:29.17]But cloak me in your mantle and keep me out of sight
[06:06.73]In the middle of the night she heard the bridle ring
[06:12.59]She heeded what he did say and young Tam Lin did win
[06:21.75]Then up spoke the Faery Queen, an angry queen was she
[06:28.85]Woe betide her ?ill-fought? face, an ill death may she die
[06:36.65]Oh, had I known, Tam Lin, she said, what this knight I did see
[06:44.03]I have looked him in the eyes and turned him to a tree
