[00:20.63]Well you're sick, sick, sickness spreads
[00:24.51]Through those veins into your bed
[00:27.19]A fiend fakes out smiles instead
[00:29.82]While I wait here alone
[00:33.45][01:29.90]So what, my conscience bothers me
[00:36.65][01:33.15]So what, that's who I've got to be
[00:39.89][01:36.40]Oh God, how inspirational
[00:41.95][01:12.28][02:24.02] 
[00:42.97][01:39.72]Don't take all this shit personal
[00:45.90][01:42.58][02:44.10]I don't mind, mind the time
[00:48.72][01:45.40][02:47.34]The time it takes to find you
[00:51.97][01:04.59][01:48.40][02:01.02][02:49.59][03:02.15]Go on, go on and thrill me
[00:54.90][01:51.15][02:52.28]Go on, go on, go on
[00:57.47][01:54.59][02:55.97]If looks could kill, she's killed for less
[01:01.03][01:57.59][02:58.84]The less you are convinced
[01:07.70][02:04.02][03:05.60]Go on, go on, go
[01:17.73]Well you're sick, sick, eyes are dull
[01:21.71]Feeling like some criminal
[01:23.59]I know you got a better place to go
[01:26.15]While I drink here alone
[02:14.02][02:26.53]Looking out the corner of her blue angelic eyes
[02:17.28][02:29.59]��Hold your breath, hold your breath, hold your breath��
[02:20.40][02:32.84]Trying to find a place inside the world that you despise
[03:14.15]Go on, go
