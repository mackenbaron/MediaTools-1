[00:31.72]The sun and the sea
[00:37.08]The darkness in the way
[00:43.17]All the pain don't get no better
[00:48.47]It gets stronger every day
[00:52.75]It happens to be true
[00:58.14]That I still pray to you my love
[01:04.40]Voices in the night don't help
[01:09.27]My searching for the truth my love
[01:15.09]When I'm lost
[01:18.58]And high above the storm
[01:21.20]I hear your name
[01:23.65][01:25.86][03:00.24][03:03.74]I'm empty inside
[01:31.94]Where are you ha ha
[01:37.34]Angela I'm still alive ah ah
[01:46.92][03:23.89]For the two of us
[01:52.29]I'm still alive
[01:57.90]You've got to imagine us
[02:03.86]All the world was on our side
[02:09.09]We had the power of the universe
[02:13.35]And we were ready
[02:14.78]We were ready for the ride
[02:19.04]Moonlight in her hair
[02:24.50]Her eyes the wonder of the age
[02:30.32]But all I mean to you my love
[02:35.01]Is just a spotlight on an empty stage
[02:41.31]And through it all
[02:44.75]One fire in the rain
[02:47.48][02:49.62]Keeps burning on
[02:52.49]I can't stop my heart
[02:55.74]It's beating for you
[02:57.06]Reaching for you
[02:58.56]But you are gone
[03:09.01]Where are you oh
[03:14.43]Angela I'm still alive (I'm still alive)
[03:29.36]I'm still alive har har
[03:36.00]Angela I'm still alive har har har har har har
[04:02.74]Angela I'm still alive har
[04:13.68]Angela (Angela) I'm still alive
[04:20.63]Oh yeah Angela I'm still alive
