[00:32.38]As you close your eyes
[00:36.00]I'll become a dream
[00:40.09]Fading like the last star in the sky
[00:48.12]With this final kiss
[00:51.74]Stolen from your lips
[00:55.29]You must be the strong one
[01:01.66]Do what's right for you and I
[01:04.33][02:10.50][03:13.39]Oh I will sing my requiem
[01:10.55][02:17.46][03:20.51]To a love that hurts with every breath
[01:17.86][02:25.10][03:27.77]And as I walk alone
[01:22.33][02:29.12][03:31.46]And live without your love,
[01:26.50][03:36.03]I will sing my requiem, my requiem
[01:34.17][03:43.98]To you.
[01:39.25]We met just by chance
[01:43.03]Or just by mistake,
[01:46.64]The universe was playing with our lives
[01:54.74]It was all a game
[01:58.62]Until I realized you're the one
[02:04.10]I've needed all this time
[02:07.77]You saved my life
[02:33.28]I will sing my requiem,
[02:37.49]my requiem To you.
[02:56.73]I see your face
[03:00.77]The rising sun
[03:04.67]And then I realize that you are gone
[03:51.83]To you
