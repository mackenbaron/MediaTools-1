[00:19.98]Running from the nightmare
[00:21.71]In the middle of the road
[00:24.65]Hell's no place for sleeping
[00:27.02]In a world beyond control
[00:29.48]Caught in the headlights
[00:32.22]Coming after you
[00:35.50]When I woke up this morning
[00:37.52]I had to do what I gotta do
[00:40.90][00:48.42][01:45.38][02:47.89]Blast me to Heaven for loving you
[00:57.00][01:21.96][01:59.00][02:29.80][03:03.14][03:48.86][04:02.30]

[01:09.89][01:19.88][02:14.84][02:24.52][03:44.38]On wheels, on wheels
[01:12.93][02:17.35][03:38.13]Oh, let it bleed
[01:15.63][02:20.38]Greased lightning
[01:24.05]I've seen a train full of pain
[01:26.03]On the edge of overload
[01:28.94]We're in Heaven, baby
[01:31.57]You are gonna implode
[01:34.56]I've got these crazy feelings
[01:36.93]That I can't explain
[01:39.97]I've gotta save you baby
[01:42.38]Or I'll die in vain
[01:51.47]I said blast me to Heaven just for loving you
[02:01.79]I said speed
[02:55.30]I said blast me to Heaven for loving you
