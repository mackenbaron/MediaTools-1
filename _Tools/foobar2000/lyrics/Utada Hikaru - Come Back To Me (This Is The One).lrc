[00:18.36]Men in suits who think they know it all
[00:24.06]No one knows me but they know my name
[00:29.17][00:52.26][01:44.32]That's not real to me
[00:34.79]Hotel lobby to the airplane
[00:41.31]Another country but they
[00:43.58]start to look the same
[00:47.09]Watch the world behind
[00:50.26]a windowpane
[00:57.55][01:50.62][03:00.17]When I see my babies run
[01:03.78]When all the madness has been and gone
[01:09.87][02:01.98][03:11.52]I raise my family and live in peace
[01:15.08][02:06.88][02:53.06][03:16.46][03:22.32]Now thats what's real to me
[01:20.31][03:26.96]Real to me
[01:26.57]Dying flowers in a dressing room
[01:33.12]A dangerous time to let your head make
[01:36.66]up its own mind
[01:39.28]Got me thinking that the spirit's flown
[01:55.92]When all the madness
[01:58.25]has been and gone
[02:13.12]Picnics in the garden and the
[02:15.85]children they can play
[02:18.77]The first day of the summer and
[02:21.51]I'll laze here all the day
[02:24.69]And we'll invite the family round and
[02:27.13]drink some English tea
[02:30.34]Then I raise up my finger and watch
[02:33.40]football on TV
[03:05.33]When all the madness has
[03:08.01]been and gone
[03:31.24]Wake up you might be dreaming
