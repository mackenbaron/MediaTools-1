[00:16.42]Thinking back when we first met
[00:22.21]I remember what You said
[00:27.04]You said You'd never leave me,
[00:35.33]I let go of Your hand
[00:40.88]Built my castle in the sand
[00:44.60]But I'm reaching out again
[00:48.12]And I'm not letting go 'til You
[00:54.13]Hold me,
[00:56.70]mold me
[00:58.64][02:18.44]Sometimes I feel so all alone,
[01:05.90]See I gotta find my way back home
[01:10.65][02:30.81][03:26.98]So why don't You
[01:13.09]Shape me,
[01:15.13]make me,
[01:17.71][02:37.72][03:34.16]Wash me whiter than the snow
[01:25.09]I gotta find my way back home.
[01:36.33]Master, upon my knees I pray
[01:42.19]I just wanna be the clay
[01:46.70]Put Your arms around me,
[01:55.56]Place my life in Your hands
[02:01.09]Lord, I know I'm just a man
[02:05.43]Hope You understand
[02:08.03]This time I'm not letting go til You
[02:13.99]Anoint me,
[02:15.84]appoint me
[02:26.52][03:22.92]I'm on my way back home
[02:33.80]Chastise me,
[02:35.09]baptize me,
[02:45.28]I gotta find my way.
[02:49.84]Cause I'm lost and alone
[02:54.23]I've been wandering long enough to know
[03:00.76]Humbly I search for You
[03:04.07]And I'm not gonna rest til You
[03:10.56]Choose me,
[03:13.45]use me
[03:14.97]Sometimes I feel so all lone
[03:29.09]Direct me,
[03:31.75]bless me
[03:43.07]I am on my way back home
