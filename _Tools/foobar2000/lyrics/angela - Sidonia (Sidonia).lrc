[00:00.00][01:13.95][02:37.97]Hush little angel, won't you try
[00:06.16][01:19.58][02:43.60]The devil hears you when you cry

[00:24.77]So you can't and you won't
[00:30.45]Give up the ghost now
[00:33.49]Leave it alone
[00:35.31]You know you don't need those lessons
[00:39.45]Someone else learned
[00:42.50]It's your life
[00:44.69]It's your right to burn
[00:48.77]So you count and discount
[00:53.79]All the cracks in the pavement
[00:57.45]As you move about
[00:59.42]You say that you'll take the push
[01:02.36]For the sake of the pull
[01:05.70]When you're deaf dumb and blind
[01:08.43]Your eyes don't feel the wool
[01:12.11]And every time it's
[01:25.97][02:49.97]Hush little angel close your eyes
[01:31.38]Think pleasant dreams and truer lies
[01:37.03]It's not like those tales
[01:42.07]Of glass and devotion
[01:45.47]They like to sell
[01:47.34]Oh you just want to be wanted
[01:51.25]It's making you sick
[01:54.11]But it's all right
[01:56.07]Oh yeah, it's only a prick
[02:00.05]And that's how you know
[02:03.37]That it's bad
[02:05.32]It's the problem with pain
[02:08.32]It's just something to have
[02:11.34]Oh, babe you're running the clock
[02:14.33]Cuz, you can't make it stop
[02:18.07]So just sit still
[02:20.32]And hope the hammer won't drop
[02:24.15]And every time it's ...
[02:55.20]Think pleasant dreams and bluer skies
[03:01.97]Angel don't you cry
