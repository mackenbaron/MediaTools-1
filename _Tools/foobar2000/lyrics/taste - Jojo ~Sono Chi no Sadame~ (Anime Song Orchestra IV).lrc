[00:49.36][02:54.53][03:00.70][03:06.42][03:12.37][03:18.34][03:24.15][03:30.13][03:36.15]Am I really all the things that are outside of me?
[00:55.58]Would I complete myself without the things I like around?
[01:01.15]Does the music that I make play on my awkward face?
[01:07.15]Do you appreciate the subtleties of taste buds?
[01:13.26]My friend and me were having laughs
[01:17.86]In a living room filled with arts and crafts
[01:24.02]He said "I like their clothes and their charming ways,
[01:30.19]But what I really want is a simple place,
[01:35.78]With no fashion clothes 'cause you can't eat those"
[01:50.68]Only Ma'd pretend to like the clothes you showed to me,
[01:57.61]Something in my heart can tell me it's a weakness,
[02:03.48]And maybe you would have more luck playing those tasty games,
[02:09.54]But me, I called and called and never heard from her again.
[02:15.66]She's too good to share our favorite things,
[02:20.57]I'll keep an open mind if you let me in.
[02:26.52]Don't let your temper rise, don't get a bitter face.
[02:31.99]Try not to judge me on my kind of taste.
[02:38.34]And don't go changing clothes when they don't like yours.
