[00:02.04] 
[00:04.29]Clothes are kinda funny
[00:05.67]hair is kinda wild and free
[00:09.82][00:26.95]Oh, but Love grows where my Rosemary goes
[00:14.17][00:31.76][01:08.81][01:44.81]And nobody knows like me
[00:19.42]She talks kinda lazy
[00:22.68]people say she she's crazy
[00:24.46]And her life's a mystery
[00:39.10]There's something about her hand holding mine
[00:42.35]It's a feeling that's fine
[00:43.05]And I just gotta say
[00:47.15]She's really got a magical spell
[00:51.77]And it's working so well
[00:53.37]That I can't get away
[00:56.73]I'm a lucky fella
[00:57.59]And I've just got to tell her
[01:00.41][01:37.22]That I love her endlessly
[01:03.41]All Love grows where my Rosemary goes
[01:32.96]Yeah I'm a lucky fella
[01:34.81]And I just gotta tell her
[01:40.04]Oh, cause love grows where my Rosemary goes
[01:58.00][02:07.07]Like me
[02:12.55]End
