[00:23.30]Boxes of ten
[00:30.56]Cool to the touch
[00:33.42]You warn me so much
[00:38.08]The white to your left
[00:40.72]The red to your right
[00:43.05]Are all that I'd seen
[00:48.21]Til I realised the love that I seek

[01:25.58]I love your delicate way
[01:36.35]The chill in my veins
[01:38.91]Relieves me from pain
[01:41.41]Again and again
[01:46.37]I lose all control
[01:48.80]Your taking your toll
[01:51.11]And i'm no longer sane
[01:55.90]Dont be afraid
[01:58.04]The love that I show is the love that you made
[02:05.61]So dont be afraid
[02:08.01]'Cos your in control
[02:10.96]I'm just your slave

[02:24.52]I love ya,
[02:29.63]Especially today,

[02:58.04]I won't let him put you down
[03:03.84]'Cos your as good as the rest
[03:07.50]And you're much better dressed
[03:09.80]I think pink is my colour
[03:12.32]I wont drink from no other
[03:14.34]Never!
