[00:08.25]-John Legend
[00:12.00]《August Rush》
[00:16.00]As days go by
[00:18.04]and fade to nights
[00:20.30]I still question
[00:22.10]why you left
[00:24.18]I wonder how
[00:26.20]it didn't work out
[00:28.25]but now you're gone
[00:29.80]and memories all I have for now
[00:34.11]but no it's not over
[00:36.25]we'll get older we'll get over
[00:40.11]we'll live to see the day that I hope for
[00:44.24]come back to me
[00:45.80]I still believe that
[00:49.36]we'll get it right again
[00:53.32]we'll come back to life again
[00:55.98]we won't say another goodbye again
[01:00.16]you'l live forever with me

[01:12.62][01:20.76][02:23.12][02:31.16][02:39.22][02:43.41][02:47.25]we'll be together
[01:26.66]I heard someday
[01:28.49]might be today
[01:30.71]mysteries of destinies they
[01:34.70]are somehow
[01:36.59]and are someway
[01:38.78]for all we know
[01:40.14]they come tomorrow
[01:42.74]for today
[01:44.72]my eyes are open
[01:46.69]my arms are raised for your embrace
[01:50.54]my hands are here to mend what is broken
[01:54.70]to feel again to walk on the face
[01:59.50]I believe there is more to life
[02:03.44]oh I love you much more than life
[02:06.46]be still
[02:07.54]I believe I can change your mind
[02:10.69]revive what is dying inside
[02:17.07]and someday, someday
[02:53.64]someday
