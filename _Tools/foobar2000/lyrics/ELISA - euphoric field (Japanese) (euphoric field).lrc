[00:13.85]Why am I standing alone in the twilight
[00:20.13]Let me go,no more lonely nights
[00:26.61]I take a deep breath under the bazy sky
[00:32.90]Feel like losing, but it's gonna be alright

[02:34.53]Need to be strong enough to swallow my pride
[02:40.88]I have been looking for my onw style
[02:46.64]Don't give it up,here comes the life
[02:59.64]I have leained a great deal
