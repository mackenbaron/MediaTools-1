[00:03.15]album: All Things Bright and Beautiful
[00:06.35]album released on June 14, 2011
[00:15.90][03:12.67]I saw the autumn leaves
[00:18.48][03:15.51]Peel up off the street
[00:21.66][03:18.64]Take wing on the balmy breeze
[00:24.27][03:21.23]And sweep you off your feet
[00:27.64]And you blushed as they scooped you up
[00:30.15]On sugar maple wings
[00:33.65]To gaze down on the city below
[00:36.29]Ablaze with wondrous things
[00:39.74][01:15.70][02:48.71]Downy feathers kiss your face
[00:43.46][01:19.41][02:52.33]And flutter everywhere
[00:45.68][01:21.59][02:54.49]Reality is a lovely place
[00:49.43][01:25.43][02:58.30]But I wouldn't want to live there
[00:55.74][03:04.49]I wouldn't want to live there
[01:03.83]Weighed down by heavy lids and lunar lullabies
[01:09.65]I knew you were wide awake
[01:11.96]'Cause you smile with your eyes
[01:27.67]From the green belt balcony
[01:30.67]The wildfires look so pretty
[01:33.71]Ponderosa canopy
[01:36.06][01:48.16]I'd never leave if it were up to me
[01:39.74]To the ruby redwood tree
[01:42.59]And to the velvet climbing ivy:
[01:45.66]Painted all mahogany
[01:55.46](If it were up to me)
[02:02.94]With a starry brush
[02:05.46]Paint the dusk venetian blue
[02:08.41]'Cause in the evening hush
[02:11.28]You'll never believe the view
[02:14.06]And when the leaves return
[02:16.69]And their whisperings fill the night
[02:19.80]They'll freeze and burn where fire and ice collide
[02:28.91]Where fire and ice collide
[02:36.68]Can you feel a silk embrace in the satin air?
[02:42.66]If we dissolve without a trace
[02:46.36]Will the real world even care?
