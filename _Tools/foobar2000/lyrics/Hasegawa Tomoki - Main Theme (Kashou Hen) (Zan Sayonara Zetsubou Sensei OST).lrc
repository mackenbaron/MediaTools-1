[00:12.12]Sometimes the world
[00:12.87]tries to knock it out of you
[00:18.50]But I believe in music
[00:20.39]the way that some people
[00:21.27]believe in fairy tales.
[00:37.20]I like to imagine that what I hear
[00:40.10]came from my mother and father.
[00:58.11]Maybe the notes I hear...
[01:00.30]are the same ones they heard
[01:03.10]the night they met.
[01:06.59]Maybe that's how they found each other.
[01:12.59]Maybe that's how they'll find me.
[01:44.50]I believe that, once upon a time
[01:47.50]long ago
[01:50.65]they heard the music and followed it.
