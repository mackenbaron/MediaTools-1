[ti:Eclipse]
[ar:Silent Cry]
[al:Goddess Of Tears]

[00:17.35]I hear the wind whisper a sweet serenade
[00:28.15]That makes me
[00:31.59]find long roads
[00:35.60]Between fantasies and desires
[00:48.42][01:45.26][02:15.49][03:17.15] 
[00:53.88][01:51.93]Supreme suffering, simple love...
[00:59.61][01:58.19]The sun and the moon meet for an instant
[01:06.80][02:05.01]THey are lovers
[01:16.00]Universe, the looking!!!
[01:20.36]Eternal in the winter,
[01:26.14]dying autumn
[01:30.00]So much feeling, so much forgetfulness
[02:48.49]Pleasure abysses
[02:52.00]Separated days, charming and despised
[03:03.67]That will never become eternal.
[03:11.59]Between fantasis and desires...
[03:21.92]End........
