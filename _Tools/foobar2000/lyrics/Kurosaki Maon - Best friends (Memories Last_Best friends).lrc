[01:18.44]For me a different scenery just mean a different position
[01:22.07]In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
[01:26.00]In the chopper or on the jet join the mile high club
[01:28.16]I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
[01:29.55]But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know

[02:43.57]Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
