[00:00.00]Leonard Cohen - Nightingale
[00:00.01][00:40.86][01:30.76][02:13.91] 
[00:00.68]I built my house beside the wood
[00:05.75]So I could hear you singing
[00:10.61]And it was sweet and it was good
[00:15.49]And love was all beginning
[00:20.58][01:10.50][01:50.83]Fare thee well my nightingale
[00:25.68][01:15.53]'Twas long ago I found you
[00:30.83][01:20.38]Now all your songs of beauty fail
[00:35.69][01:25.45]The forest closes 'round you
[00:50.62]The sun goes down behind a veil
[00:55.67]'Tis now that you would call me
[01:00.52]So rest in peace my nightingale
[01:05.72]Beneath your branch of holly
[01:55.56]I lived but to be near you
[02:00.55]Tho' you are singing somewhere still
[02:05.56]I can no longer hear you
