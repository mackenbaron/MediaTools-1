[00:12.39]She blew my mind behind the wrecking machine
[00:14.37]She was a shitload of trouble called the Subway Queen
[00:17.11]Had a hip with bad habits and a shake that was a bit obscene
[00:21.36][00:31.16][00:45.87][01:12.59][01:27.02][01:38.79][01:51.68][02:16.44][02:37.22] 
[00:22.43]One night I caught her running out the cellar door
[00:24.95]There was about a million people lying flat on the floor
[00:27.96]For such a sweet little lady I would swear she's rotten to the core
[00:36.02]She got her hands in the cookie jar
[00:38.38]Smiling like an alligator
[00:41.34][02:31.88]Makin' headlines in the back of her car
[00:43.83][02:34.46]Tight-lipped now but sink ships later
[00:46.65][01:52.59][02:37.56]I know a thing or two about -- sweet little sister
[00:51.83][01:57.59][02:42.47]Her mama kill her if she knew what she do -- sweet little sister
[00:57.16][02:03.00][02:47.73]She'll love ya black and blue -- sweet little sister
[01:02.45][02:08.43][02:53.31]Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
[01:04.58][02:10.24][02:55.21]She's my sweet little -- sweet little sister
[01:18.03]Every quittin' time is another disease
[01:20.14]Too many cowboys ridin' high shootin' low at the knees
[01:23.01]The back hand boogie is the price you pay for being the squeeze
[01:28.72]The pettin's getting heavy got her tongue in her ear
[01:30.81]her friend is doing time for kickin' ass on a queer
[01:33.70]They're in a mental state and all their friends are here
[01:41.86]She's tellin' lies through her burgundy lips
[01:44.39]Angel on a mission of mercy
[01:47.25]She'll get you dancin' with the crack of her whip
[01:49.56]Take you up to heaven in her rocket ship
[02:27.05]She got her hands in the cookie jar smiling like an alligator
