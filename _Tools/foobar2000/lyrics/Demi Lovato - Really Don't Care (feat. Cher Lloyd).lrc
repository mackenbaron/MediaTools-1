[00:01.48]Demi Lovato - Skyscraper
[00:08.50]Skies are crying
[00:10.72]I am watching
[00:12.85]Catching tear drops in my hands
[00:16.42][00:24.73][00:45.88][00:49.83][01:02.58][01:08.53][01:17.41][01:26.14][01:30.58][01:34.51][01:38.82][01:46.71][01:50.62][02:04.04][02:08.32][02:25.25][02:30.68][02:35.54][02:42.07][02:46.64][02:52.73][02:59.63][03:09.61][03:14.25][03:19.07] 
[00:17.20]Only silence as it's ending
[00:21.57]Like we never had a chance
[00:25.87]Do you have to make me feel like
[00:30.55]There's nothing left of me
[00:34.45][01:35.24][02:32.01]You can take everything I have
[00:38.59][01:39.47][02:36.32]You can break everything I am
[00:42.50][01:43.60][02:40.19]Like I'm made of glass
[00:46.83][01:47.67][02:44.43]Like I'm made of paper
[00:51.69][01:52.89][02:49.33]Go on and try to tear me down
[00:56.00][01:57.05][02:53.54]I will be rising from the ground
[01:00.01][01:03.93][02:01.00][02:05.28][02:57.58][03:01.94][03:06.50][03:10.52][03:15.04]Like a skyscraper
[01:09.59]As the smoke clears I awaken
[01:13.86]And untangle you from me
[01:18.17]Would it make you feel better
[01:22.80]To watch me while I bleed
[01:26.87]All my windows still are broken
[01:31.17]But I'm standing on my feet
[02:11.66][02:20.27]Go run run run
[02:13.82]I'm gonna stay right here
[02:16.17]Watch you disappear
[02:18.65]Yeah oh
[02:22.44]Yeah it's a long way down
[02:25.86]But I am closer to the clouds up here
[02:47.47]Oh Oh
