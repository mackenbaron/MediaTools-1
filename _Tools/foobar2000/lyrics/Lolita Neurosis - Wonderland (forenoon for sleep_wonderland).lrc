[00:12.69][00:35.53][00:58.79][01:31.10][02:19.66][02:43.03][03:10.27][03:42.02] 
[00:14.69][02:22.47]Tell me you love me baby
[00:17.85]I've got this world to show you
[00:20.91]You can leave everything you got behind
[00:26.31]We don't need a plane to get there
[00:29.42]'Cause I got this glow inside me
[00:32.59]But its only shining when you're around
[00:38.11]All that you want is waiting
[00:41.19]I know which path to get there
[00:43.95]Follow white rabbit and unlock the door
[00:49.59]You won't be without me baby
[00:52.43]'Cause I've got this flow about me
[00:55.41]But I'm only gliding when you're around
[01:00.87]'Cause we've got flowers everywhere
[01:06.16]Caterpillars over there
[01:12.76]All you need  Just make a wish
[01:17.63]Now just close your eyes
[01:22.58][01:28.14]You're living now in Wonderland
[01:59.25]When we collided baby
[02:02.46]I knew a star was shining
[02:05.00]We didn't even leave a single piece behind
[02:10.46]We don't need to take a picture
[02:13.53]'Cause I've got this brush inside me
[02:16.61]I could paint a rose any style ya like
[02:25.34]'Cause this is my world to show you
[02:28.00]We can have a Tea time anytime you like
[02:33.75]All you need is love to be here
[02:36.88]Royal Heart's will kneel before you
[02:39.77]Fairytales are made so that YOU come to life
[02:44.98]'Cause we've got mountains high up there
[02:50.47]Miles of oceans over there
[02:56.41]All you need, just make a wish
[03:01.99]now just close your eyes
[03:06.51]You're living now in wonderland
[03:35.43]I Can forget Tweedle Dee Tweedle Dum
