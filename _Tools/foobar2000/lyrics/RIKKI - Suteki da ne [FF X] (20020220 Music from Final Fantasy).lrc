[00:38.74]We hear you're leaving, that's OK
[00:42.12][00:48.55][00:50.95][00:57.14][00:59.25][01:06.41][01:11.25][01:14.91][01:22.69][01:27.56][01:31.85][01:35.85][01:40.26][01:52.95][02:01.00][02:09.21][02:16.38][02:21.21][02:25.07][02:32.28][02:37.69][02:41.77][02:45.91][02:50.27][03:34.10][03:37.78][03:43.38][03:47.04][03:50.99][03:58.12][04:03.40][04:07.40][04:11.51][04:15.72][04:26.47] 
[00:46.74]I thought our little wild time
[00:49.08]had just begun,
[00:55.03]I guess you kind of scared yourself,
[00:57.73]you turn and run
[01:03.44]But if you have a change of heart.
[01:08.93][01:25.30][02:19.06][02:35.53][03:44.85][04:00.93]Rikki don't lose that number;
[01:11.98][02:22.10][03:47.90]You don't wanna call nobody else.
[01:17.51][02:27.65][03:53.46]Send it off in a letter to yourself.
[01:28.94][02:39.06][04:04.64]It's the only one you own.
[01:32.84][02:42.94][04:08.54]You might use it if you feel better,
[01:38.40][02:48.47][04:14.07]When you get home.
[01:49.14]I have a friend in town,
[01:51.32]he's heard your name.
[01:57.26]We can go out driving
[01:58.99]on Slow Hand Row
[02:05.54]We could stay inside
[02:07.04]and play games I don't know
[02:13.57][03:39.51]And you could have a change of heart.
[03:31.41]You tell yourself you're not my kind
[03:35.43]But you don't even know your mind.
[04:19.52][04:23.75]Rikki don't lose that number
[04:21.64](Rikki don't lose that number)
