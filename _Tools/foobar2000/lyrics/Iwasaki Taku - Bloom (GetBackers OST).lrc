[01:00.77]Open your mouth wide
[01:09.42][01:18.95][01:35.40][01:45.24][01:58.95][02:30.00][02:42.75][02:55.59][03:08.39][03:33.51][03:43.52][04:01.93].
[01:13.62]A universal sigh
[01:26.45]And while the ocean blooms
[01:39.49]It's what keeps me alive
[01:52.03]So why does this still hurt
[02:04.89]Don't blow your mind with why
[02:17.19]--solo--
[03:25.14]I'm moving out of orbit
[03:37.76]Turning in somersaults
[03:50.87]I dive into those eyes
[04:03.89]Jellyfish go by
[04:28.39]----end----
