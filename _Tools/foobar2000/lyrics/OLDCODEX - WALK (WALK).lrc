[00:13.53][03:11.58]Wake up fail again, attempt to whisper back
[00:16.66]Do you have the same dream every night?
[00:19.72]震えてた瞬間へ繋がる
[00:25.92]そうさ君も全てを賭けて
[00:29.02]戦う場所へ飛び出したら
[00:32.14]You can believe it
[00:33.39]That's the way it have to be
[00:38.29]Win or not what's worth the meaning
[00:41.24]Nowhere so deep, fade away
[00:44.50]見失った物が多い気がした
[00:52.24]Blink about the miracle
[00:53.77]So tell ask yourself,Walk out hit the sound
[00:56.97][03:34.82]あの日のリズム今刻む
[00:59.94][03:37.84]Yes I'm reaching out,Walk on everlong
[01:03.04][03:40.93]遠くに見てた未来掴んだ
[01:06.19][03:44.08]Red pulse rushing through,and I can hear you
[01:09.25][03:47.20]溢れたノイズをかき鳴らす
[01:12.34][03:50.29]未来図は泡の様に
[01:16.77]Attract to the miracle
[01:24.79]Keep track of little vouce,left and right,upside down
[01:27.85]Everytime you say again,annoyed of your story
[01:30.95]薄れ行く記憶の中で
[01:37.14]後悔しても始まらないさ
[01:40.16]考え過ぎて機を逃したら
[01:43.34]Let it clear out
[01:44.64]That's the way it should be
[01:49.35]To find a word to say to you
[01:52.34]Sail in high seas,intercept
[01:55.68]確実を手にしたこの瞬間を
[02:03.43][03:19.36]So tell ask myself,Walk now watching at
[02:06.51][03:22.38]半端な姿見せずに泣いて
[02:09.60][03:25.48]Yes you're reaching out,Walk then searching for
[02:12.69][03:28.55]蹴散らす今を捨てずに描いて
[02:15.83]Blue pulse rushing through,and you can hear me
[02:18.92]迷わず明日へとギア上げて
[02:22.01]限界を超えて行けば
[02:26.46]Splashi to the miracle
[02:31.02]Bling back the Catalyst and beat will go on
[02:34.06]About time now I'm ready to face the fate
[02:43.60]Better to go or not,and to be or not
[02:46.61]全て自分で決めて行け
[02:49.68]In the lost and found,picking up the sign
[02:52.84]必然と感じた What are the chances?
[02:56.10]そう合図は今君の手にも
[03:14.70]I'm a looser, expecting to become the 1
[03:31.71]So tell ask yourself,Walk　響く
[03:55.86]弾け飛んだ　Attract to the miracle
