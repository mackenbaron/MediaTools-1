[00:00.56]I'Ll Walk Aone - Various Artists
[01:20.77][01:36.12][02:18.12]I'll  walk alone
[01:21.96][01:26.32][01:37.31][01:51.21] 
[01:22.51]Because to tell you the truth,
[01:24.45]I'd be lonely
[01:27.20]I don't mind being lonely
[01:31.16]When my heart tells me you
[01:34.31]are lonely too
[01:37.86]They'll ask me why
[01:39.12]And I'll  tell them I'd rather
[01:42.64]There are dreams I must gather
[01:46.71]Dreams we fashioned the night
[01:49.76]You held me tight
[01:51.83]I'll  always be near you
[01:54.27]Wherever you are each night
[01:57.60]In every prayer
[01:59.29]If you call I'll hear you
[02:02.05]No matter how far
[02:03.38]Just close your eyes
[02:05.50]and I'll be there
[02:07.11]Please walk alone
[02:09.13]And send your love and your kisses
[02:12.00]to guide me
[02:14.15]Till you're walking beside me
