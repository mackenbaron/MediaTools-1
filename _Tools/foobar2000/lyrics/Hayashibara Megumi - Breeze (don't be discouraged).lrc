[00:36.85][01:54.89]My heart is leaving you
[00:38.79][01:57.11]It says goodbye
[00:41.09][01:59.77]Disappering from you tonight
[00:45.89][02:05.16]Not a breeze is gonna
[00:50.00][02:07.75]pass you by
[00:54.15]There are sailingboats
[00:56.35]There are shops
[00:58.92]Broken rafts adrift
[01:03.14]I'm jumping on
[01:05.39]whatever's passing by
[01:37.86]I've blown the candle out
[01:40.24]that you forgot
[01:42.00]I've made sure that
[01:43.95]the door is shut
[01:47.03]I don't think you're ever
[01:50.27]coming back
