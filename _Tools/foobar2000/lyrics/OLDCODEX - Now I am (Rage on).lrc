[00:10.91]A girl came running over to me
[00:16.42]put the stones that she found,in my hand
[00:21.92]when I woke up
[00:24.27]the clock showed me
[00:27.27]that I was left behind
[00:30.08]with a sip of coffee
[00:33.69][01:44.65]she said,this looks like jewel
[00:37.29][01:48.28]then I wondered,where did my heart color go
[00:44.57][01:55.50]the stone spoke in the white sheer light
[00:49.49][02:00.34]it shed tears,dropped on the palette
[00:57.27][02:08.25]still and stuck unfocused
[01:02.78]launched on,hunt for 君の幻影は
[01:08.20][02:19.09]まだ進めなくて　could't take another step forward
[01:17.34][03:34.13]I know, I was pathetic
[01:21.89]if this breeze is Lord's blessing
[01:27.25]how would I reflect
[01:32.69]did I have a dazzling smile
[01:38.14]when I was a child
[01:40.85]now I am seeing too many things
[02:13.63]launched on,hunt for　君の幻影は
[02:28.28]you know, I was pathetic
[02:32.75]jewel,
[02:33.72]傷つく事で磨かれて
[02:38.10]jewel all different just like us
[02:43.32]so bright in one's heart
[02:45.99]the stone on the sidewalk
[02:49.10]will flourish its shine
[03:05.44]just want you to know
[03:07.57]I had seen upon
[03:10.52]in spite that I hurt you,my jewel
[03:17.56]now I am focused
[03:18.83]launched on,hunt for 僕の声が
[03:22.83]もう届かなくて　could't take another step forward
[03:27.95]you know,I was made of plastic
